                    <strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in the DRC and moved

                    deciding to return to school.

                    <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I started out in surgical
                    technology but after a few semesters doing clinicals, (the smell of
                    burning flesh, blood and the OR smell) I decided it wasn't for me, so
                    I’m now completing my associates in IT- Full stack.

                    can’t stand public speech, it makes me panic to the point I lose my
